## Tokencraft: Where Design Meets Ownership

Tokencraft is a groundbreaking web3 design marketplace built on the [insert blockchain platform - e.g., XDC Network or Ethereum] blockchain. We empower designers to own their work, earn fair compensation, and unlock the true value of their creations.

## Problem

Existing design marketplaces leave creators underpaid and undervalue their work. Limited revenue sharing models and rampant piracy stifle creativity and hinder the growth of high-quality design assets.

## Solution

#### Tokencraft leverages web3 technology to create a fairer and more secure design ecosystem:


- **Tokenization:** Design files are tokenized, granting creators ownership and control.

- **Dynamic Pricing:** Token value determines price â€“ popular designs earn creators more.

- **Secure Storage:** Blockchain technology protects design files from piracy.

- **Transparent Transactions:** All transactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
Community


- **Creators:** Earn fair compensation, maintain control, and connect with a global audience.

- **Buyers:** Access high-quality, secure design assets and support talented creators.

   ***Tokencraft fosters a vibrant community of creators and buyers:*

*This is a work-in-progress for the [DIMO HACK VIT-AP] hackathon. We're actively developing the Tokencraft platform and welcome contributions!*

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Project**:
```
    https://github.com/SuhasLingam/dotETH-DimoAp.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Client Directory**:
```
    cd client
```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
```
    npm install
```
4. **Navigate to `data.js` and Add Your Credentials**:
- Locate the `data.js` file within the project.
- Replace the `SENDER_ADDRESS` and `PRIVATE_KEY` placeholders with your actual Ethereum address and private key.

5. **Launch the Development Server**:
```
    npm run dev
```

## Deployment Note
> :warning: **MVP and Hackathon Stage**: This project has been deployed on the Core testnet for demonstration and testing purposes. Due to the MVP stage of development and the constraints of a hackathon timeline, we focused on showcasing the core functionalities without implementing a centralized backend. Such a backend would be required for real-time data synchronization and accurate blockchain updates, but developing this component was beyond our scope within the given time frame.
